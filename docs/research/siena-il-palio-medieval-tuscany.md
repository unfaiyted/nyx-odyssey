# Siena & Il Palio — Medieval Tuscany Research

**Duration:** 2-3 days (can be a long day trip, but overnight is strongly recommended for Palio)
**Best for:** Medieval history, Il Palio horse race (July 2!), Tuscan food & wine, contrada culture
**Budget level:** Moderate (accommodation spikes during Palio week)

---

## 🚗 Getting There from Vicenza

- **By car:** ~3.5 hours via A1/E35 (~350 km). Siena's historic center is a ZTL (restricted traffic zone) — do NOT drive in. Park at **Stadio** (Fortezza) or **San Francesco** garages on the edge of the center, ~€2/hour or €15-20/day
- **By train:** Vicenza → Firenze SMN (2h Frecce) → Siena (1.5h regional). Total ~3.5-4 hours with connection. Direct Trenitalia regionale from Florence
- **Recommendation:** Car is ideal if combining with Chianti drives and San Gimignano. Park outside the walls and walk in — the centro storico is compact and entirely walkable

## 🏇 IL PALIO DI SIENA — July 2, 2026

### ⚡ THIS IS THE BIG ONE. WE'RE IN ITALY FOR THIS.

The Palio is a bareback horse race around Piazza del Campo that has been run since the medieval era. It happens twice yearly: **July 2** (Palio di Provenzano, in honor of the Madonna of Provenzano) and August 16. The race itself lasts roughly **90 seconds** — three laps of the shell-shaped piazza — but the entire spectacle spans **4 days** of trials, parades, rituals, and neighborhood rivalry that makes the race almost secondary to the experience.

### How It Works

- **17 contrade** (neighborhoods) exist, but only **10 race** each Palio. Seven that didn't race the previous corresponding Palio are automatic; three more are drawn by lot
- Horses are assigned to contrade by lottery (the *tratta*) — contrade have their own jockey but NOT their own horse
- Jockeys receive a *nerbo* (bullwhip) to urge their horse or hinder opponents — this is medieval, not sanitized
- A horse can win **without its jockey** (called a *cavallo scosso*) — it just has to cross the finish line first
- The *mossa* (start) is notoriously chaotic — horses line up between two ropes, with the 10th contrada starting from behind and choosing the moment to charge

### 📅 Schedule of Events (June 29 – July 2)

**June 29 — Tratta (Horse Assignment)**
- Morning: Horses are selected and assigned to contrade by lottery
- Afternoon trial (19:30): First trial run

- Afternoon trial: 19:30

**July 1 — General Trial + Contrada Dinners**
- Morning trial: 9:00 AM
- Afternoon: **Prova Generale** (dress rehearsal, 19:30) — the most important trial

**July 2 — PALIO DAY**
- 8:00 AM: *Messa del Fantino* (Jockey's Mass) at Palazzo Pubblico chapel
- 9:00 AM: Final trial (*Provaccia*) — intentionally light
- 10:30 AM: *Segnatura dei fantini* — jockeys officially confirmed, no substitutions after this
- ~15:00: Horses blessed in each contrada's oratory — **deeply moving ritual, worth seeing**
- 15:30: First warning signal
- 16:40: Track clearing begins
- 17:00-17:15: Historical Parade (*Corteo Storico*) enters Piazza del Campo — **spectacular medieval pageantry** with flag-throwers, drummers, figurants in full Renaissance regalia

- Post-race: Winning contrada **EXPLODES** in celebration — partying lasts until dawn

### 🎟️ Do You Need Tickets?

**For the center of the piazza (the free zone): NO TICKETS NEEDED — it's FREE**

This is the authentic experience — standing in the packed center of the Campo with 30,000-40,000 people. It's raw, intense, and electric. However:

**Viewing Options:**

1. **Free standing in the piazza center** (the *curva*)
   - FREE but arrive **by noon at latest** (many say by 10-11 AM)
   - Once you're in, you're IN — no leaving and re-entering
   - You'll be standing for 6-8+ hours in July heat
   - Views are limited (you'll see horses fly past, but won't see the whole track)
   - The communal energy is absolutely unforgettable — this IS the Palio
   - Bring: water (no lids allowed on bottles), snacks/energy bars, sunscreen, hat
   - NO chairs, stools, or strollers allowed

2. **Balcony/window seats (grandinate)**
   - €150-400+ per person depending on location
   - Booked through building residents or local agencies
   - Include shade, views of the entire track, and usually toilet access
   - **Book 3-6 months ahead** — these sell out fast
   - Check: paliodisiena.com, sienaincoming.it, or contact hotels for connections

3. **Elevated free spot near Fonte Gaia**
   - The slope near the fountain offers slightly elevated views
   - Arrive by 2 PM to claim a spot
   - A good middle ground — better sightlines than deep in the crowd

4. **Trial runs (prove)** — Much less crowded, still thrilling
   - Great way to experience the piazza atmosphere without the extreme crush
   - Enter by 18:00 for evening trials

### ⚠️ Safety & Practical Tips

- **No children under 10** allowed in the piazza on race day (even with adults)
- **No dogs** allowed
- **Wear closed-toe shoes** — you will get stepped on in the crowd
- **No containers with lids** or frozen bottles allowed (security measure)
- The crowd is intense but generally safe — maintain situational awareness
- **Post-race celebration gets rowdy** — winning contrada parties hard, stay alert for flying flags and surging crowds
- The Palio involves **real danger for riders** — this is not a sanitized tourist event. Falls at San Martino curve are common
- **Most restaurants close** during the race — eat beforehand or pack food
- **Hydrate aggressively** — July in Tuscany is HOT (30-35°C / 86-95°F)

### 🍽️ Contrada Dinners (Cene della Prova Generale)

The evening of July 1 (after the General Trial), each contrada hosts a **massive outdoor banquet** in their neighborhood streets. Long tables, hundreds of people, local food, flowing wine, singing contrada songs. This is the SOUL of the Palio.

- **Can tourists attend?** YES — many contrade sell seats to outsiders
- **How to book:** Contact the contrada directly (each has a website/social media) or ask your hotel. Reserve **weeks in advance**
- **Cost:** Usually €30-50 per person for a full multi-course meal with wine
- **What to expect:** Incredible atmosphere, communal dining, contrada songs and chants, genuine local hospitality
- **Tip:** Buy a *fazzoletto* (contrada scarf, ~€15) from their museum and wear it proudly

## 🏛️ Major Sights

### 1. Piazza del Campo

The shell-shaped central square — one of the most beautiful public spaces in the world. Even without the Palio, it's mesmerizing.

- **Shape:** Unique concave fan divided into 9 segments (representing the medieval Council of Nine)
- **Torre del Mangia:** The 102-meter bell tower of the Palazzo Pubblico — climb it for panoramic views (400 steps, €10). Open 10:00-19:00 in summer
- **Palazzo Pubblico & Civic Museum:** Houses Ambrogio Lorenzetti's famous *Allegory of Good and Bad Government* frescoes (1338) — one of the most important secular artworks of the Middle Ages. €10 entry
- **Fonte Gaia:** The ornate marble fountain at the top of the piazza (replica — originals by Jacopo della Quercia are in the museum)
- **Best way to enjoy it:** Grab a gelato, sit on the brick campo, and people-watch. The piazza slopes downward toward the Palazzo — pick a spot and soak it in

### 2. Siena Cathedral (Duomo di Siena)

A masterpiece of Italian Romanesque-Gothic architecture. The striking black-and-white striped marble exterior is iconic.

- **Interior highlights:**
  - **Marble floor:** 56 incredibly detailed narrative scenes carved and inlaid over centuries (partially covered; fully uncovered Aug-Oct). Extraordinary
  - **Piccolomini Library:** Breathtaking frescoes by Pinturicchio depicting the life of Pope Pius II. Don't skip this — it's a hidden gem inside the cathedral
  - **Pulpit by Nicola Pisano** (1268): One of the great masterpieces of Gothic sculpture
  - **Bernini's sculptures** in the Chigi Chapel
- **Battistero (Baptistery):** Below the cathedral, with a stunning baptismal font featuring panels by Donatello, Ghiberti, and Jacopo della Quercia
- **OPA SI Pass:** Combined ticket (~€15-20) covers Cathedral, Piccolomini Library, Baptistery, Crypt, and the Panoramic Terrace (Facciatone) — the unfinished wall of the planned cathedral expansion, offering spectacular views
- **The "New Cathedral":** Siena once tried to build a cathedral so massive that the current Duomo would be just the transept. The 1348 Black Death killed so many that they never finished — the remaining wall (Facciatone) is now a viewing platform. Haunting and beautiful

### 3. The Contrade (Medieval Neighborhoods)

Siena is divided into **17 contrade**, each with its own:
- Church/oratory, museum, fountain, flag, and animal symbol
- Annual festivals and feast days
- Deep rivalries (some contrade are *alleati*, some are bitter enemies)
- Baptism ceremonies (babies are baptized into the contrada, not just the church)
- Social clubs, community activities, charitable works

**Notable Contrade to Explore:**
- **Oca (Goose):** Near the Duomo — strong, historic, and proud
- **Torre (Tower):** Enemy of Oca — the rivalry is legendary
- **Selva (Forest):** Known for the beautiful Rhino fountain
- **Aquila (Eagle):** The only contrada with territory outside the city walls
- **Lupa (She-Wolf):** Near San Domenico, with Roman mythology connections

**How to explore:** Wander the streets and look for contrada flags, street lamps with animal symbols, and small museums. Many contrade have museums open to visitors (€5-8) with Palio memorabilia, historic banners (*drappelloni*), and costumes

### 4. Other Notable Sights

- **Basilica of San Domenico:** Houses the preserved head of St. Catherine of Siena (yes, really). Important Gothic church
- **Santa Maria della Scala:** Former medieval hospital, now a massive museum complex with frescoes, archaeological exhibits, and underground tunnels
- **Via Banchi di Sopra / Via di Città:** The main shopping/strolling streets — beautiful palazzi on every side
- **Fortezza Medicea:** The Medici fortress, now a park with wine bars and panoramic views. Home to the *Enoteca Italiana*
