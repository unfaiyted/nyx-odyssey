## 🏰 Treviso Old Town — The Highlights

### Piazza dei Signori
- The main square and "living room" of Treviso
- Framed by the 13th-century **Palazzo dei Trecento** (council hall, still in use)
- Outdoor cafés under arcades — perfect for a morning espresso
- Featured in the Italian film *Signore e Signori*

### The Canals — "Little Venice"
- **Buranelli Canal:** The iconic postcard shot — ivy-draped balconies, pastel houses reflected in the water. Named after merchants from Burano who traded here
- **Cagnan Canal (Cagnan Grande):** Flows through the heart of the old town, powers medieval water wheels still turning today
- **Riviera Garibaldi:** Scenic canal-side walk with weeping willows
- Much smaller and more intimate than Venice — think "Venice's quieter, prettier cousin"

### Isola della Pescheria (Fish Market Island)
- A tiny island in the Cagnan canal that hosts Treviso's **fish market**
- Open **Tuesday–Saturday mornings** (best before 11 AM)
- Surrounded by fruit/vegetable stalls on the adjacent canal banks
- One of the most atmospheric market settings in the Veneto
- **Don't miss:** The views from the bridges on either side

### The Duomo (Cathedral)
- Neoclassical façade hides interior treasures
- **Titian's Annunciation** in the Malchiostro Chapel
- Chapels by Tullio Lombardo

- Adjacent Chapter House has 40 Dominican scholars at their desks, each with distinct personality
- Free entry, often overlooked by tourists

## 🍝 Food & Drink in Treviso

### Signature Dishes

#### Tiramisu — Born Here
Treviso claims to be the **birthplace of tiramisu**. Two restaurants dispute the title:
- **Le Beccherie** — Most widely credited, claims invention in the 1960s. Classic version with espresso-soaked ladyfingers and mascarpone
- **Toni del Spin** — Also claims the invention. Traditional trattoria with excellent version

**Verdict:** Try both and decide for yourself.

#### Radicchio di Treviso
- **Season:** Late autumn through winter (November–February)
- Two varieties: **Precoce** (early, wider leaves) and **Tardivo** (late, prized elongated form — the real deal)
- **Tardivo** is the star — sweet-bitter, crunchy, looks like a purple flame
- Preparation: Grilled with olive oil, in risotto, or raw in salads
- If visiting Nov-Feb, this is a MUST — it's a protected IGP product, tastes nothing like the sad radicchio in US supermarkets
- **Radicchio festivals** happen in January in surrounding towns (Castelfranco, Casier)

### Best Restaurants

| Restaurant | Style | Known For | Price |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Toni del Spin** | Traditional trattoria | Tiramisu, local Veneto dishes | €€ |
| **Le Beccherie** | Historic restaurant | "Original" tiramisu, classic Trevigiana cuisine | €€-€€€ |
| **Osteria Muscoli's** | Seafood osteria | Fresh fish near the Pescheria | €€ |
| **Trattoria all'Antico Portico** | Traditional | Handmade pasta, radicchio dishes | €€ |
| **Hostaria Dai Naneti** | Bacaro/wine bar | Cicchetti, natural wines | € |

### Cicchetti Bars (Bacari)
Treviso has its own cicchetti culture, similar to Venice but less touristy:
- **Dai Naneti** — Beloved local bacaro, excellent small plates with wine
- **Cantinetta Venegazzù** — Central location, typical cicchetti with local wines
- **Enoteca Il Bacaro** — Good wine selection, aperitivo culture
- **Bar Ai Porteghi** — Under the arcades of Piazza dei Signori
- Cicchetti typically €1-3 per piece, paired with an *ombra* (small glass of wine) for €1-2

### Gelato & Sweets
- Try **Gelateria La Romana** or small artisan spots in the old town
- Tiramisu gelato is everywhere — embrace it

## ⚖️ Is It Worth It? Day Trip Comparison

| Destination | Time from Vicenza | Best For | Duration Needed | Crowds |
|------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Treviso** | 1 hr (train/car) | Canals, food, Prosecco | Half or full day | Very low |
| **Venice** | 1 hr (train) | Grand canals, art, architecture | Full day+ | Very high |
| **Verona** | 30 min (train) | Arena, Romeo & Juliet, wine | Half or full day | Moderate |
| **Padua** | 25 min (train) | Giotto's chapel, university | Half day | Low-moderate |
| **Bologna** | 1.5 hr (train) | Food capital, porticoes | Full day | Moderate |
| **Lake Garda** | 1 hr (car) | Scenery, Sirmione castle | Full day | Moderate-high |

### Verdict
**Treviso is a strong half-day destination** that becomes a **standout full-day trip when combined with the Prosecco Hills**. On its own, the old town is charming but compact — 3-4 hours covers the highlights. The real magic is the combo:

- Morning: Treviso's canals, markets, cicchetti
- Afternoon: Rolling through UNESCO Prosecco vineyards, wine tasting

**If choosing between Treviso and Venice:** Venice is the once-in-a-lifetime must-do. Treviso is the "I want the real Italy" alternative. Both are worth doing if time permits.

**If you only have one free day:** Venice or the Dolomites probably win. But if you've already done Venice, Treviso + Prosecco is a perfect "relaxed Italian day."

**Best season:** Late autumn (Nov-Dec) for Radicchio di Treviso Tardivo season. Spring/early summer for the vineyards at their greenest. Summer can be hot and humid.

## 📝 Practical Tips

- **ATMs:** Available throughout the old town
- **Language:** Less English spoken than Venice — a few Italian phrases go a long way
- **Treviso Airport:** Ryanair hub (Treviso is sometimes marketed as "Venice-Treviso" for flights)
- **Market days:** Tuesday–Saturday mornings for the fish market; general market spreads along the canals
- **Siesta:** Many shops close 12:30–15:30. Plan accordingly.
- **Dress code:** Casual. This isn't Milan or Venice — it's a relaxed provincial city
- **Safety:** Very safe, even at night. Minimal tourist scams (there aren't enough tourists for scammers)
- **Budget:** Significantly cheaper than Venice. Cicchetti lunch + wine: ~€10-15pp. Full restaurant meal: €20-35pp.
