|------------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Da Enzo al 29** | Classic Roman pastas | €30–50/pp | No reservations. Arrive 30 min before opening (12:00 or 18:30). Best carbonara & cacio e pepe |

> ⚠️ **Local tip:** Trastevere has gotten very touristy. The best spots are on quieter side streets, not the main piazzas. A local Reddit thread notes: "the cuisine is often adapted to tourists' tastes" — stick to the tried-and-true spots above.

### Testaccio (Where Romans Actually Eat)
| Restaurant | Specialty | Price | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Flavio al Velavevodetto** | Roman classics, built into Monte Testaccio | €30–45/pp | Cacio e pepe is legendary. Reservations essential |

### Centro Storico (Pantheon / Navona / Campo de' Fiori)
| Restaurant | Specialty | Price | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Armando al Pantheon** | Traditional Roman since 1961 | €35–50/pp | Steps from Pantheon but NOT a tourist trap. Book ahead |
| **Salumeria Roscioli** | Gourmet deli + restaurant | €50–70/pp | Outstanding wine list, incredible cheese/cured meats. Reservation essential |
| **Emma Pizzeria** | Roman pizza near Campo de' Fiori | €20–30/pp | Great for families. Thin crispy Roman-style |

### Other Neighborhoods Worth the Trek
- **Pizzarium Bonci** (Cipro/Vatican area) — Best pizza al taglio in Rome, possibly Italy. Run by Gabriele Bonci. €5–10
- **Roscioli Caffè** (near Campo) — Pastries and breakfast

## 🏨 Where to Stay — Best Neighborhoods

### Trastevere ⭐ (Top Pick for Atmosphere)
- **Vibe:** Bohemian, cobblestoned, lively nightlife, great restaurants
- **Pros:** Most charming neighborhood, walkable to Centro Storico, great aperitivo scene
- **Cons:** Can be noisy at night, touristy main streets, not near a metro
- **Budget:** €100–180/night (boutique hotels/Airbnb)

### Monti (Top Pick for Location)
- **Vibe:** Hip, artsy, village-like feel near ancient sites
- **Pros:** Walking distance to Colosseum + Forum, great bars/restaurants, metro access (Cavour)
- **Cons:** Small area, can feel crowded
- **Budget:** €90–160/night

### Centro Storico (Pantheon/Navona area)
- **Vibe:** Heart of Rome, stunning architecture everywhere
- **Pros:** Central to everything, beautiful streets
- **Cons:** Expensive, touristy, noisy
- **Budget:** €150–300/night

### Testaccio (Best for Foodies on a Budget)
- **Vibe:** Authentic working-class Roman, food paradise
- **Pros:** Best restaurants, great nightlife, metro access (Piramide), affordable
- **Cons:** Fewer "sights," less polished
- **Budget:** €70–130/night

### Prati (Near Vatican)

## 💳 Roma Pass — Worth It?

### 48-Hour Roma Pass: €33
- 1 free museum/site entry + discounts on others
- Unlimited public transport (metro, bus, tram)

### 72-Hour Roma Pass: €53
- 2 free museum/site entries + discounts
- Unlimited public transport

### Verdict: **Probably Not Worth It in 2025**
- The Colosseum and Vatican (your two biggest tickets) are **NOT included** in the Roma Pass
- Borghese Gallery is NOT included
- Pantheon is only €5
- A 72-hour transit pass costs €18 on its own — decent savings if you ride a lot
- **Math:** If you'd only use it for transport + Capitoline Museums (€15), the 48hr pass barely breaks even
- **Better strategy:** Book individual tickets for your must-sees and buy a BIT transit pass (€7/day or €18/72hr) separately
- **Exception:** Worth it if you plan to visit 3+ smaller museums (Borghese doesn't count)

## ☀️ Summer Heat Survival Tips

Rome in July–August regularly hits **35–40°C (95–104°F)** with intense humidity. This is serious.

### Timing Strategy
- **Start early (7:30–8:00 AM)** — Do outdoor sights before 11 AM
- **Siesta (13:00–16:00)** — Go to museums, churches (air-conditioned!), or your hotel
- **Resume at 16:30–17:00** — Golden hour sightseeing until dark
- **Dinner at 20:30–21:00** — Romans eat late, and it's still warm enough to enjoy outdoor dining

### Essentials to Pack/Buy
- **Water bottle** — Refill at Rome's 2,500+ *nasoni* (public drinking fountains). Water is clean, cold, and free
- **Sunscreen SPF 50** — Reapply constantly, especially at Forum/Palatine (zero shade)
- **Hat + sunglasses** — Non-negotiable
- **Light, breathable clothing** — Linen is your friend. Note: shoulders and knees must be covered for churches/Vatican
- **Cooling towel** — Soak and drape around neck
- **Handheld fan or mini USB fan** — Lifesaver in queues
- **Electrolytes** — Bring packets, Italian pharmacies sell them too

### Cool-Down Spots
- **Churches** — Free, air-conditioned, beautiful. Duck into any church for 10 minutes of relief
- **Villa Borghese Gardens** — Shaded park, breezes, lake
- **Trastevere's narrow streets** — More shade than wide boulevards
- **Gelato** — Medicinal in summer (obviously)
- **Shopping malls** — Galleria Alberto Sordi (near Trevi) has AC and beautiful architecture

---

## 🚇 Getting Around

### Metro
- **2 lines:** A (orange) and B (blue), plus C (still expanding)
- **Line A:** Ottaviano (Vatican), Spagna (Spanish Steps), Barberini (Trevi area), Termini
- **Line B:** Colosseo (!), Circo Massimo, Piramide (Testaccio), Termini
- **Single ride:** €1.50 (100 min, valid for 1 metro ride + unlimited buses)

- **Buy at:** Any tabacchi shop, metro station machines, or Tabnet app
- **Hours:** 5:30 AM – 11:30 PM (until 1:30 AM Fri–Sat)

### Walking
- Rome is very walkable. Most major sights in Centro Storico are within 20–30 min of each other
- **Cobblestones everywhere** — Wear comfortable shoes with good soles (no flip-flops for sightseeing)
- **Hills:** Aventine, Palatine, Capitoline, Pincian — some steep climbs

### Buses & Trams
- Useful for Trastevere (tram 8 from Largo Argentina) and longer distances
- **Bus routes:** Google Maps is reliable for Rome transit
- **Pickpocket warning:** Buses 40 and 64 (Termini ↔ Vatican) are notorious. Keep valuables in front pockets/money belt

### Taxis & Rideshare
- **Official taxis** are white with meters. Insist on the meter
- **Fixed fares:** Termini ↔ Fiumicino Airport = €50 (fixed by law)
- **Uber** works but is essentially just official taxis via app (no UberX)
- **FREE NOW app** — Better for booking taxis in Rome

### Bars & Aperitivo
- **Salotto 42** (near Pantheon) — Stylish cocktail bar, great aperitivo spread
- **Il Barretto** (Via del Galoppatoio) — Hidden behind Villa Borghese, sophisticated

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Dress code for churches:** Shoulders and knees must be covered at St. Peter's, Vatican Museums, and most major churches. Carry a light scarf or shawl
2. **Pickpockets are real:** Especially at Termini station, on bus 64, around Colosseum, and crowded tourist spots. Use a crossbody bag or money belt
3. **Don't eat within eyeshot of a major monument** — Walk 2–3 blocks away for better food at lower prices
4. **Tap water is safe and free** — *Nasoni* fountains are everywhere. Block the spout hole and water shoots up like a drinking fountain
5. **Coins for Trevi:** Use small coins. Legend says 1 coin = return to Rome, 2 = fall in love, 3 = marriage
6. **Tipping:** Not expected but rounding up (€1–2) is appreciated at restaurants. "Coperto" (cover charge, €1–3) is standard and NOT a tip
7. **Lunch specials:** Many restaurants offer *pranzo* (lunch) menus that are significantly cheaper than dinner
8. **Sundays:** Many shops closed, some restaurants too. Museums often have reduced hours. Plan accordingly
9. **Monday:** Many museums closed (NOT the Colosseum or Vatican). Check individual schedules
10. **Download offline Google Maps** for Rome — saves battery and works in the metro
