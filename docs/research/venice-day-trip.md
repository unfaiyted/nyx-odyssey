- **Validate:** Tap card on yellow reader before boarding EVERY time
- **Key lines:**

  - **Line 3:** Direct to Murano from Piazzale Roma
  - **Line 12:** Murano ↔ Burano ↔ Torcello

## ☀️ Summer-Specific Tips

### Beating the Crowds
- **Arrive by 8:30 AM** — Venice is nearly empty before 10 AM
- **Visit St. Mark's at opening (9:30)** or late afternoon
- **Avoid:** 10 AM–4 PM at major sites (peak cruise ship + day tripper hours)
- **Best strategy:** Do major sites early morning, explore neighborhoods midday, return to popular areas at golden hour
- **Tuesday-Thursday** generally less crowded than weekends
- **Early June** is best compromise — warm but not peak insanity yet
- **July-August:** Hottest, most crowded, many locals on holiday

### Heat Management
- **Temperatures:** 28-35°C (82-95°F) in July-August, high humidity
- **Carry water** — fountains exist but aren't abundant
- **Midday break:** Take a long lunch or visit air-conditioned museums 12-3 PM
- **Gelato strategy:** Multiple stops throughout the day are medically necessary
- **Shade:** Narrow alleys are naturally cooler than open squares
- **Sun protection:** Hat, sunscreen, sunglasses essential. Limited shade on vaporettos.

### Flooding (Acqua Alta)
- **Summer:** Very unlikely. This is a fall/winter phenomenon (Oct-Mar)
- **Not a concern** for summer visits

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Get lost on purpose.** Venice's magic is in the unexpected — a quiet campo, a canal with no one around, a hidden church. Put away the phone for an hour.

2. **Spritz protocol:** Aperol Spritz is tourist default. Locals drink Select Spritz (more bitter, more Venetian). Try both.

3. **Cicchetti crawl > sit-down restaurant** for lunch. Hit 3-4 bacari near Rialto between 11-1 PM.

4. **Water:** Tap water is safe and free in Venice (from the mainland aqueduct). Ask for "acqua del rubinetto" at restaurants.

5. **Navigation:** Venice has yellow signs pointing to major landmarks (Rialto, San Marco, Ferrovia/station, Piazzale Roma). Follow these when lost.

6. **Gondola reality check:** €80 for 30 min (€100 after 7 PM) for up to 6 people. Romantic but expensive. Alternative: €2 traghetto (gondola ferry) across Grand Canal at several crossings.

7. **No wheels in Venice.** No rolling suitcases if you can avoid it — bridges = stairs everywhere.

8. **Scam watch:** Only buy glass marked "Vetro Artistico Murano" with the trademark. Lots of Chinese-made fakes.

9. **Free church art:** Many churches have incredible art. Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari and San Zaccaria have masterpieces rivaling any museum.

10. **The best time in Venice is 7-9 PM.** Day trippers have left, cruise ships have departed, golden light hits the canals. This is when Venice becomes Venice.

## 🎭 Hidden Gems & Lesser-Known Experiences

### Libreria Acqua Alta
- A bookshop where books are stored in gondolas, bathtubs, and waterproof bins (because flooding). Cats everywhere. Staircase made of old encyclopedias. Instagram-famous but still charming.
- **Location:** Castello, near Campo Santa Maria Formosa
- **Cost:** Free to browse

### Scala Contarini del Bovolo
- Hidden Renaissance spiral staircase with rooftop views. Most tourists never find it.
- **Location:** Near Campo Manin, San Marco
- **Cost:** €8
- **Tip:** Follow the small signs from Campo Manin — it's tucked in an alley

### Traghetto Rides
- For €2, ride a gondola across the Grand Canal standing up like a local. Seven traghetto crossings exist. The one near Ca' d'Oro → Rialto Market is the most scenic.

### Squero di San Trovaso
- One of the last working gondola boatyards. You can watch craftsmen from across the canal (best viewed from Osteria Al Squero with a spritz in hand).

### Giudecca Island
- Just across from Dorsoduro (Vaporetto Line 2). Almost zero tourists. Visit the Molino Stucky (now a Hilton, but the rooftop bar has incredible views). Walk the Fondamenta to Chiesa del Redentore (Palladio).

### Early Morning Fish Market
- Rialto's Pescheria at 7:30 AM is a sensory explosion — fishmongers unloading the catch, locals haggling, no tourists. Pair with coffee at a nearby bacaro.
