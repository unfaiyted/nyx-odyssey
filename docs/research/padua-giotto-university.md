## 🎨 Scrovegni Chapel (Cappella degli Scrovegni)

### Why It Matters
The Scrovegni Chapel houses **the single most important fresco cycle in Western art** — Giotto's revolutionary masterpiece, painted 1303–1305. These frescoes essentially **invented modern painting**:
- First true use of perspective and three-dimensional space (a century before the Renaissance)
- Unprecedented emotional realism in human figures
- The famous blue ceiling — a mantle of stars you'll never forget
- Scenes include *The Kiss of Joachim and Anne at the Golden Gate*, *The Lamentation of Christ*, *The Last Judgement*

The cycle narrates the History of Salvation: Stories of the Virgin and Christ along the walls, Vices and Virtues in the lower register, and the massive Last Judgement on the entrance wall.

## 🍹 Aperitivo & Spritz Culture — The Birthplace

### The Padua Spritz Story
Padua has a legitimate claim as the **birthplace of the modern Aperol Spritz**. Aperol was created in Padua in 1919 by the Barbieri brothers, who debuted it at the Padua International Fair. The spritz tradition (adding sparkling water to wine) was already Venetian, but the Aperol version became Padua's identity.

GQ once named Padua the **"public drinking capital of the world"** — and at 6 PM on any given day, you'll understand why. The entire city floods its piazzas for aperitivo.

### The Padua Spritz Crawl

| Bar | Location | Why Go |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Bar Nazionale** | Piazza delle Erbe | By the fruit market. Famous toasted tramezzini (sopressa, fontina, raw red cabbage). Legendary. | 
| **Canaja** | Piazza delle Erbe | Newer, hip. They ask which vermouth you prefer. DOCG Prosecco spritzes. |
| **Corte Sconta** | Via dell'Arco (Ghetto) | Venetian-style wine bar. Free-form spritz (Aperol poured over ice, topped from bar hose). Excellent crostini. Cross-section of Padua's people. |
| **Caffè Pedrocchi** | Via VIII Febbraio | *The* historic café, open since 1831. Three rooms (white, red, green = Italian flag). Elegant spritzes, pastries, hot chocolate. Also great for cocktails at night. |
| **Gran Caffè Diemme** | Piazza dei Signori | Best cocktails in Padua. Generous natural wine selection. |
| **La Yarda** | Via Dondi dall'Orologio | 26+ spritz variations. Bob Marley soundtrack. Fun and casual. |
| **Enoteca Treccani** | Near center | Local wines + live jazz. Evening spot. |
| **Bar dei Osei** | Piazza della Frutta | Famous for its spritz. Teeming terrace. Classic. |
| **Caffè della Piazzetta** | Ghetto area | Hip, shaded terrace. Ideal for an afternoon aperitivo. |

### Aperitivo Tips
- **Standard spritz price:** €2.50–6 depending on the bar
- **Peak hours:** 6:00–8:00 PM daily (weekends can start at 5 PM)
- **Local style:** Spritz served in a tumbler (not the balloon glass you see elsewhere)
- Many bars include free cicchetti/snacks with your drink
- **Weekend:** Aperitivo happens twice — afternoon and evening
