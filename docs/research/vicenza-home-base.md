## ☕ Coffee Shops & Cafés

Italian coffee culture rules: espresso at the bar (standing) is cheapest (€1–1.30). Sitting down (especially outside) costs more. No one bats an eye at lingering over a cappuccino.

| Café | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Antica Pasticceria Sorarù** | Piazzetta A. Palladio, 17 | Historic pastry shop (since 1904). Exquisite pastries, classic coffee. A Vicenza institution. |
| **Pasticceria Declaire** | Contrà Cavour | Modern pastry shop, creative dolci and excellent espresso |

| **Caffè Garibaldi** | Piazza dei Signori | Tourist-facing but unbeatable location. Perfect people-watching |
| **Gran Caffè** | Corso Palladio | Classic café on the main drag |

### Best for Working/Wifi
Italian cafés aren't really "laptop cafés" like US coffee shops. For extended working sessions:
- **Geco Lounge Café** — Most wifi-friendly
- **Il Ceppo** — Bistrot downstairs, can linger
- Better bet: coworking space (see below) or work from your apartment

---

## 🍹 Aperitivo & Bars

Aperitivo in the Veneto is sacred. The Spritz was born here. Expect Aperol Spritz, Hugo (elderflower), Select Spritz (the local one), and Campari Spritz. A drink (€3.50–6) usually comes with free snacks/cicchetti.
