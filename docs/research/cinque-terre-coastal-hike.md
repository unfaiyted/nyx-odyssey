## ⚠️ Important Tips

1. **Check trail status before going:** https://www.parconazionale5terre.it — sections close regularly for landslides/maintenance
2. **Start early** — trails get hot and crowded by midday
3. **Hike south → north** — you end at Monterosso (biggest beach, best for relaxing after)
4. **Wear proper shoes** — flip-flops will get you fined (seriously) and are dangerous on the rocky trails
5. **Bring enough water** — limited refill points between villages
6. **Don't drive into the villages** — park at La Spezia or Levanto
7. **Book Nessun Dorma** or arrive by 10 AM — fills up fast
8. **Off-season advantage** — spring/fall means fewer crowds, lower card prices, cooler hiking temps
