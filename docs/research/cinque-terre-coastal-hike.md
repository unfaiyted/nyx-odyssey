## 🥾 Hiking Trails

### Sentiero Azzurro (Blue Trail) — The Main Coastal Hike
- **Total distance:** ~12 km (Riomaggiore → Monterosso)
- **Total hiking time:** 5–6 hours (all 4 segments)
- **Difficulty:** Easy to moderate
- **Trail card required:** Yes (Cinque Terre Trekking Card or Treno MS Card)

| Segment | Distance | Time | Difficulty | Status (Feb 2026) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Riomaggiore → Manarola (Via dell'Amore) | 1 km | 20-30 min | Easy | ✅ OPEN | Reopened Aug 2024! One-way only (Rio→Man). Requires CT Card + €10 surcharge. Wheelchair accessible. |
| Manarola → Corniglia | 2 km | 40-60 min | Moderate | ❌ CLOSED | Closed due to landslide. No ETA for reopening. Alternative: Manarola-Volastra-Corniglia (also currently closed for maintenance) or train. |
| Corniglia → Vernazza | 3.2 km | 70-100 min | Moderate | ✅ OPEN | Most scenic section — dramatic coastal views, forest paths, panoramic viewpoints over both villages. |
| Vernazza → Monterosso | 3.3 km | 80-120 min | Moderate | ✅ OPEN | Steepest section. Beautiful glade near start with iconic Vernazza photo spot. Return trek harder due to sharp slope near Monterosso. |

### Summer 2026 Hiking Outlook
As of Feb 2026, three of four Sentiero Azzurro segments are open. The Manarola→Corniglia section has been closed since ~2016 (landslide) and is unlikely to reopen by summer 2026. **Practical impact:** You'll need to take the train between Manarola and Corniglia (~3 min ride).

## 🚆 Train Logistics

### Getting There from Vicenza
1. **Vicenza → La Spezia Centrale** — ~2.5 hrs (Trenitalia regional or Intercity)
2. **La Spezia → Cinque Terre villages** — 5-10 min on Cinque Terre Express
- Trains run every 15-30 min between all five villages
- Total journey: ~3-3.5 hours

### Alternative: Drive to La Spezia or Levanto
- Vicenza → La Spezia: ~2.5 hrs via A12 (tolls ~€15-20)
- **Park at La Spezia** (Parking P1 near station, ~€10-15/day) and take train in
- Or park in **Levanto** (cheaper, slightly shorter drive) — one stop north of Monterosso
- ⚠️ Do NOT drive into the villages — extremely limited parking, narrow roads, restricted access

---

## 🎫 Cinque Terre Card (2026 Prices) — Is It Worth It?

### Trekking Card (Trails Only)
- **€7.50/day** (low season) — **€15/day** (peak weekends)
- Only covers trail access (Monterosso↔Corniglia sections)

### Treno MS Card (Trails + Unlimited Trains) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
| Period | 1 Day | 2 Days | 3 Days |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low season (green) | €19.50 | €34 | €46.50 |
| Medium season (yellow) — **June, Sept** | €27 | €48.50 | €65.50 |
| Peak season (red) — **July/Aug weekends** | €32.50 | €59 | €78.50 |

**Includes:** Unlimited Cinque Terre Express trains (La Spezia–Levanto), trail access, free WC at stations, free local buses, reduced museum admission in La Spezia.

### Is the Card Worth It?
**YES, almost always.** A single train ticket between villages costs €2.70-5. If you take 4+ trains (very likely), the card pays for itself. Plus you get trail access included. For a day trip: **1-day Treno MS Card is a no-brainer.**

**Note:** Via dell'Amore requires CT Card + additional €10 surcharge.

**Buy at:** any CT train station, tourist info points, or online at parconazionale5terre.it.

## ⛵ Boat Tours Between Villages

### Public Ferry (Consorzio Marittimo)
- **Season:** March 28 – November 1, 2026 (reduced schedule in shoulder season)
- **Stops:** La Spezia, Portovenere, Riomaggiore, Manarola, Vernazza, Monterosso, Levanto
- ⚠️ **No Corniglia stop** (no harbor — clifftop village)
- **Frequency:** Multiple daily departures (Apr 20–Sep 27 has the fullest schedule)

| Ticket Type | Adult | Child (6-11) |
|---|---|---|
| Full-day hop-on/hop-off roundtrip | €42 | €15 |
| Afternoon roundtrip (from 2 PM) | €28 | €15 |
| One-way with intermediate stops | €30 | €15 |
| Children under 6 | Free | — |

**Pro tip:** The afternoon ticket (€28) is great value — arrive by train in the morning, hike, then boat back in the afternoon for stunning coastal views.

### Private Boat Hire
- Captains at each harbor offer transfers and sightseeing
- One-way village transfer: ~€35-60 (split among 3-4 people = very affordable)
- Great crowd-avoidance strategy when trains are packed

### Boat vs Train
- **Boat:** Gorgeous views of the coastline from the water, more relaxing, but weather-dependent and less frequent
- **Train:** Reliable, frequent (every 15-30 min), cheap with CT Card, but stations can be mob scenes at peak times

---

## 🌡️ Summer Crowd Management

### How Bad Are Crowds in Late June / July?
- **Late June:** Busy but manageable. Classified as "medium season" (yellow) for pricing. Day-trippers and cruise ships are the main source.
- **July weekdays:** Surprisingly, July/August can be LESS crowded than May/June/September for international tourists (too hot for many). However, Italian domestic tourists arrive.
- **July weekends:** Peak season (red). Very crowded — trails become "human traffic jams."
- **Worst days:** Easter, April 25 (Liberation Day), May 1, June 2, any 3-day weekend. One Easter saw 95,000 visitors in tiny Vernazza.
- **Cruise ship days:** Worst crowds. Check cruise schedules at La Spezia port.

### Crowd-Beating Strategies
1. **Start early (before 8 AM):** Day-trippers arrive ~10 AM, leave ~5 PM. The "golden hours" are 7-10 AM and 5-8 PM.
2. **Sleep IN the Cinque Terre:** Not La Spezia or Levanto. Being there for morning and evening transforms the experience.
3. **Be a reverse commuter:** Leave the villages during midday (10 AM–5 PM) for beach time, vineyard hikes, or trips to Levanto/Portovenere. Return for sunset.
4. **Hike the high trails:** Most tourists stick to Sentiero Azzurro. The ridge trails and sanctuary paths are nearly empty.
5. **Use boats or private transfers** when trains are overwhelmed.
6. **Visit Corniglia:** Fewest tourists (382 stairs deter many). Most authentic village feel.
7. **Avoid Vernazza at midday:** Most popular village = worst midday congestion.

### Best Time of Day
| Time | Crowd Level | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 7:00–9:00 AM | 🟢 Empty | Hiking, photography, village exploring |
| 9:00–10:00 AM | 🟡 Building | Start hikes, grab breakfast |
| 10:00 AM–5:00 PM | 🔴 Peak | Beach time, boat tours, high trails, leave main villages |
| 5:00–7:00 PM | 🟡 Thinning | Return to villages, aperitivo |
| 7:00–10:00 PM | 🟢 Magical | Dinner, sunset, village ambiance at its best |

### Heat in Summer
- Late June: 25-30°C, very manageable
- July: 28-33°C, can be intense on shadeless trails at midday
- **Avoid hiking 11 AM–3 PM** in summer. Morning hikes + afternoon swimming is the ideal pattern.

## ⚠️ Important Tips

1. **Check trail status before going:** https://www.parconazionale5terre.it and https://www.cinqueterre.eu.com/en/cinque-terre-current-situation — sections close regularly
2. **Start early** — trails get hot and crowded by midday
3. **Hike south → north** — end at Monterosso (biggest beach, best for relaxing after)
4. **The Manarola→Corniglia trail is CLOSED** — plan for the train gap
5. **Via dell'Amore is ONE-WAY** (Riomaggiore → Manarola only) and costs extra €10
6. **Don't drive into the villages** — park at La Spezia or Levanto
7. **Book restaurants** in summer — Belforte, Trattoria dal Billy, and Miky fill up
8. **Download the CT park app** for virtual waiting lists (may be required for paid trails by 2026-2027)
9. **Pesto-making classes** and **wine tastings** are great midday alternatives when trails are crowded
10. **Levanto and Bonassola beaches** are uncrowded alternatives when Monterosso is packed
