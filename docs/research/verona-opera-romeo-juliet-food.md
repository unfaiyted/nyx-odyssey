### Tips for the Opera
- **Shows start at 21:15–21:30** — arrive by 20:00 to soak in the atmosphere
- **Bring a cushion** if sitting on stone steps (or rent one for ~€3–5)
- **Candle tradition:** At dusk, the entire arena lights up with small candles — truly magical
- **No umbrellas allowed** — if it rains, the show may be delayed or cancelled (refunds available)
- **Dress code:** Smart casual; no need for formal wear but don't show up in beach clothes
- **Duration:** Most operas run 2.5–3+ hours with intermission
- **Subtitles:** Italian with English subtitles projected
- **Best value:** The stone steps (€30–52) are an incredible experience — you're IN a Roman amphitheater. Sound carries beautifully throughout
- **Best seats for first-timers:** Poltronissima Silver (€195) — great balance of comfort and proximity

### 🎯 Recommendation for June–July Trip
If attending opera, **La Traviata** (opening night Jun 12 or later) or **Aida** are the quintessential Arena experiences. Nabucco is also spectacular in this setting. Book 2-3 months ahead for best selection.

## 💕 Casa di Giulietta (Juliet's Balcony)

### The Reality
Shakespeare never visited Verona and Romeo & Juliet are fictional characters. In the 1930s, the city designated a 13th-century house as "Juliet's House" and added a balcony. It's a tourist creation — but an enormously popular one.

### Is It Worth It?
**The courtyard:** Free to enter, extremely crowded. There's a bronze statue of Juliet (touching her right breast is "good luck for love" — the statue has been replaced multiple times due to wear). Walls covered in love notes and chewing gum.

**The house/balcony:** As of late 2025, **entry costs €12** (previously free courtyard access, paid museum). The new ticketing system was introduced to manage overwhelming crowds.

### Verdict
- **Worth a quick walk-by** if you're in the area — it's in the historic center near Piazza delle Erbe
- **Not worth a long wait** — the courtyard is packed and the "balcony" is underwhelming
- **Skip paying €12** unless you're a serious Shakespeare/romance enthusiast
- **Better alternative:** Walk across the beautiful **Ponte Pietra** (Roman stone bridge) for actually romantic Verona views
- **Best time to visit:** Early morning (before 9 AM) or late evening to avoid worst crowds

## 🏛️ Historic Center Highlights

### Piazza delle Erbe
Verona's main square, built on the ancient Roman forum. Surrounded by frescoed buildings, medieval tower houses, and the Baroque Palazzo Maffei. Daily market stalls sell souvenirs, produce, and snacks. Best experienced with a spritz at one of the cafés, though tourist-trap pricing applies to the square-front tables.

**Tip:** Duck into the side streets for better-priced bars with the same atmosphere.

### Castelvecchio & Ponte Scaligero
14th-century castle turned art museum. The **Museo di Castelvecchio** houses an excellent collection of medieval and Renaissance art, masterfully renovated by architect Carlo Scarpa in the 1960s. The attached **Ponte Scaligero** (fortified bridge) offers gorgeous views of the Adige River.

- **Entry:** ~€6 (museum)
- **Worth it:** Yes — one of northern Italy's best medieval art collections in a stunning setting
- **The Scarpa renovation** alone is worth visiting for architecture enthusiasts

### Walking the Historic Center
Verona's centro storico is compact and walkable. A good route:

1. **Piazza Bra** → The massive piazza facing the Arena. Start here with a coffee.
2. **Via Mazzini** → Elegant shopping street leading to Piazza delle Erbe
3. **Piazza delle Erbe** → Main square, market, frescoed facades
4. **Piazza dei Signori** → Adjacent quieter square, Dante statue, Loggia del Consiglio
5. **Arche Scaligere** → Gothic tombs of Verona's ruling Scaligeri family (impressive exterior, viewable from street)
6. **Casa di Giulietta** → Quick photo stop on Via Cappello
7. **Ponte Pietra** → Roman bridge with views of the Teatro Romano
8. **Teatro Romano & Archaeological Museum** → Cross the bridge, climb the hill for panoramic views
9. **Castelvecchio** → Circle back west along the river
10. **San Zeno Maggiore** → If time permits, this Romanesque basilica (15 min walk west) has a stunning Mantegna altarpiece

**Time needed:** 3–4 hours for a relaxed walk covering the main sights; full day if visiting museums.

## 🍷 Wine: Valpolicella & Beyond

Verona sits at the gateway to the **Valpolicella wine region**, one of Italy's most important. The hills northwest of the city produce:

- **Valpolicella Classico** — Light, cherry-driven red. Perfect with lunch.
- **Valpolicella Ripasso** — "Re-passed" over Amarone grape skins for richer body. Excellent value.
- **Amarone della Valpolicella** — Powerful, dried-grape red wine. One of Italy's greatest wines. €30–100+ per bottle.
- **Recioto della Valpolicella** — Sweet red dessert wine made from the same dried grapes.
- **Soave** — White wine from east of Verona. Crisp, mineral, perfect aperitivo wine.
- **Custoza** — Another local white, lighter and more floral.
- **Bardolino** — Light red/rosé from Lake Garda side.

### Wine Bars in Verona

**Antica Bottega del Vino** — Via Scudo di Francia 3

### Valpolicella Wine Country Day Trip
If time allows, the wine towns of **Fumane, San Pietro in Cariano, and Negrar** are just 20–30 minutes northwest of Verona. Several estates offer tastings:
- **Enoteca della Valpolicella** (Fumane) — highly rated restaurant + wine bar in the heart of the region
