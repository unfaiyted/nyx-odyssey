## Overview

Lake Garda (*Lago di Garda*) is Italy's largest lake — a 51 km long, turquoise jewel wedged between the Alps to the north and the Po plain to the south. The southern end is gentle and Mediterranean, with olive groves and vineyards; the north is dramatic, flanked by sheer cliffs and popular with windsurfers and climbers.

**Sirmione** is the crown jewel of the southern shore — a narrow peninsula jutting 4 km into the lake, crowned with a medieval castle and Roman ruins. It's impossibly picturesque: thermal springs bubble up from the lakebed, the water is Caribbean-clear, and the old town is a car-free labyrinth of gelaterias and lakefront restaurants.

## 🏛️ Top Sights in Sirmione

### Grotte di Catullo (Grottoes of Catullus)
- **What:** Ruins of a massive Roman villa (2 hectares) at the tip of the Sirmione peninsula — the largest and best-preserved example of a Roman villa in northern Italy
- **History:** Built between the end of the 1st century BC and beginning of the 1st century AD. Named after the poet Catullus, who praised Sirmione in his poems, though the visible villa was actually built after his death. The name stuck since the 15th century when his lyric poems were rediscovered
- **Highlights:** Remarkably intact substructures, panoramic olive grove setting overlooking the lake, on-site archaeological museum (opened 1999) with finds from the area. Andrea Palladio himself studied the villa's construction techniques
- **Hours:** Tue–Sat 8:30–19:30, Sun 9:30–18:30 (summer); shorter in winter. Closed Mondays
- **Cost:** ~€8 full / €2 reduced
- **Tip:** Walk through the ancient olive grove to reach the ruins — the views alone are worth the visit. Combine with Jamaica Beach below the ruins

### Scaliger Castle (Castello Scaligero)
- **What:** A 13th-century lakeside fortress built by the Scaliger family of Verona, complete with crenellated walls, a moat, and a fortified harbor — one of the best-preserved castles in Italy
- **History:** Probably founded by Mastino I della Scala. The castle controlled access to the peninsula and its harbor could shelter the Scaliger fleet. A garrison remained until the 19th century
- **Highlights:** Climb the 146 steps of the main tower for 360° panoramic views of the lake and surrounding mountains. The drawbridge entrance is iconic
- **Hours:** Tue–Sat 8:30–19:30, Sun 9:30–18:30 (summer)
- **Cost:** ~€6
- **Tip:** You literally walk through the castle to enter Sirmione's old town — it's unavoidable and spectacular

### Terme di Sirmione / Aquaria Thermal Spa
- **What:** Sirmione sits atop natural thermal springs — sulfurous water rises from 20 meters below the lake at 69°C. Two main options:
  - **Aquaria Thermal SPA** — Modern wellness center with outdoor thermal pools overlooking the lake, saunas, steam rooms. Open to the public
  - **Terme di Sirmione (Virgilio/Catullo)** — Medical/therapeutic thermal baths, more clinical, treatments for respiratory and skin conditions
- **Cost:** Aquaria from ~€55 weekday / €65 weekend (2-hour entry); evening rates available
- **Tip:** Book Aquaria in advance in summer — it fills up. The evening session (after 17:00) is magical with sunset over the lake. The thermal water is rich in sulfur, bromine, and iodine — genuinely therapeutic
- **Free alternative:** At the tip of the peninsula near Jamaica Beach, warm thermal water seeps into the lake — you can feel it while swimming!

## 🅿️ Parking in Summer — Critical Info

**Parking in Sirmione in summer is a MAJOR issue.** The peninsula is car-free beyond the castle, and parking fills up fast.

### Parking Options
| Parking | Location | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Parcheggio Monte Baldo** | Near entrance to old town | ~€2/hr, ~€15/day | Closest to castle, fills first (by 9-10 AM in summer) |
| **Parcheggio Piazzale Porto** | Near castle | ~€2.50/hr | Very limited spots |

### Summer Strategy
1. **Arrive before 9:00 AM** — seriously, by 10 AM close-in lots are full
2. **Park at Colombare** and take the shuttle — less stress, same result
3. **Consider parking in Desenzano** and taking the ferry to Sirmione — avoids the problem entirely and gives you a scenic boat ride
4. **Weekdays are significantly better** than weekends
5. **August is peak chaos** — the peninsula road backs up and you can sit in traffic for 30+ min just to reach parking

## 📅 Day Trip vs. Overnight?

### Day Trip from Vicenza ✅ (Possible)
- 1.5 hr drive each way = 3 hrs travel
- Leaves 8–10 hours to explore
- **Realistic itinerary:** Scaliger Castle → old town walk → lunch lakeside → Grotte di Catullo → Jamaica Beach swim → gelato → drive back
- **Works if:** You leave early (by 8 AM), focus on Sirmione only, and don't mind a full day

### Overnight Stay ⭐ (Recommended)
- **Why it's better:**
  - Sirmione at sunset/night (when day-trippers leave) is magical and uncrowded
  - Time for Aquaria thermal spa (evening session!)
  - Can visit a second town (Malcesine, Limone, or Bardolino)
  - Take a ferry across the lake
  - More relaxed, no rush to beat parking or traffic
  - Morning on the peninsula before crowds arrive is peaceful
- **Where to stay:**
  - **In Sirmione:** Hotel Mavino (boutique, near ruins), Hotel Eden (lakefront, pool), or B&Bs in Colombare for budget
  - **In Desenzano:** More options, more nightlife, easy ferry to Sirmione. Good mid-range: Hotel Nazionale
  - **Budget option:** Agriturismo in the Lugana wine area between Sirmione and Desenzano
- **1 night is enough** to see Sirmione + one other town comfortably
