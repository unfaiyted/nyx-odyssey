# Naples & Amalfi Coast Research

**Duration from Vicenza:** ~4 hours by high-speed train | Multi-day trip (3-4 days recommended)
**Nickname:** Pizza, Pompeii, Paradise

## Overview

Naples and the Amalfi Coast represent southern Italy at its most intense — chaotic, beautiful, delicious, and ancient. This is a multi-day trip from Vicenza covering Naples (pizza capital of the world), Pompeii/Herculaneum (Roman ruins frozen in time), the Amalfi Coast (cliffside paradise), and optionally Capri (glamorous island). Budget 3-4 days minimum.

## 🚆 Getting There from Vicenza

### High-Speed Train (Recommended)
- **Trenitalia Frecciarossa** or **Italo**: Vicenza → Napoli Centrale
- **Duration:** ~4 hours direct (some require change in Rome/Bologna)
- **Cost:** €40-80 one-way if booked 2-4 weeks ahead (prices surge closer to travel)
- **Frequency:** Multiple daily departures
- **Book at:** trenitalia.com or italotreno.com
- **Tip:** Italo often has better prices; Trenitalia has more departures. Book early for "Super Economy" fares

### Driving
- ~650 km, 6-7 hours via A1 autostrada
- Not recommended for Naples itself (chaotic traffic, ZTL zones, parking nightmare)
- Could be useful if continuing to Amalfi Coast — but even then, driving the coast road is stressful
- **Verdict:** Train to Naples, then local transport

### Flying
- Vicenza → Naples Capodichino (VCE→NAP via budget airlines)
- ~1 hour flight but factor in airport time — train is often comparable door-to-door
- Check Ryanair/easyJet for deals from Venice Marco Polo or Verona

## 🍕 Naples — Pizza Capital of the World

Naples is where pizza was born. UNESCO recognized Neapolitan pizza-making as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. The pizza here is unlike anywhere else: blistered, wood-fired, soft soupy center, San Marzano tomatoes, hand-pulled mozzarella.

### The Holy Trinity of Pizzerias

#### L'Antica Pizzeria Da Michele
- **Address:** Via Cesare Sersale 1 (near Napoli Centrale)
- **Founded:** 1870
- **The Deal:** Only serves TWO pizzas — Margherita and Marinara. That's it. Pure focus.
- **Famous for:** Featured in *Eat Pray Love* (Julia Roberts scene). The OG purist experience.
- **Wait:** Can be 1-2 hours in summer. They have a ticket system now.
- **Cost:** €4-5 per pizza (absurdly cheap for what you get)
- **Tip:** Go at 11am opening or late afternoon to avoid worst lines
- **URL:** damichele.net

#### Gino e Toto Sorbillo
- **Address:** Via dei Tribunali 32 (Spaccanapoli)
- **Founded:** 1935 (family has been making pizza since 1920s)
- **The Deal:** More variety than Da Michele — creative toppings alongside classics
- **Famous for:** Gino Sorbillo is a celebrity pizzaiolo, on Netflix, TV personality
- **Wait:** Also long lines — arrive early or late
- **Tip:** They have multiple locations now; the Via dei Tribunali original is the one to visit
- **URL:** sfrfrancesco.sfrfrancesco.sorbillo.com

#### Pizzeria Starita a Materdei
- **Address:** Via Materdei 27/28
- **Founded:** 1901
- **The Deal:** Featured in the classic film *L'Oro di Napoli* (Sophia Loren). Known for pizza fritta (fried pizza) — a Naples street food staple
- **Famous for:** Pizza fritta and the Montanara (fried then finished in the oven)
- **Less crowded:** Slightly off the tourist trail in Materdei neighborhood
- **URL:** pizzeriestarita.it

### More Excellent Pizzerias

| Name | Specialty | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **50 Kalò** (Ciro Salvo) | Perfect Margherita | On the waterfront at Via Partenope. Less chaotic, great views |
| **Diego Vitagliano** | Modern Neapolitan | Multiple locations, innovative toppings |
| **Concettina ai Tre Santi** | Contemporary + classic | In Sanità neighborhood, Ciro Oliva is a rising star |
| **Dal Presidente** | Classic | Bill Clinton ate here — hence the name |
| **Di Matteo** | Pizza fritta | Street-side fried pizza window on Via dei Tribunali |

### Beyond Pizza — Neapolitan Food

- **Sfogliatella:** Crispy shell-shaped pastry filled with ricotta. Get one at **Sfogliatella Mary** or **Pintauro** (Via Toledo)
- **Ragù Napoletano:** Slow-cooked meat sauce, completely different from Bolognese
- **Cuoppo fritto:** Paper cone of fried seafood/vegetables — street food staple
- **Babà:** Rum-soaked sponge cake — Naples' signature dessert
- **Espresso:** Naples takes coffee deadly seriously. Stand at the bar, order "un caffè" (always espresso). Try **Caffè Gambrinus** (historic, on Piazza del Plebiscito)
- **Limoncello:** Made from Amalfi/Sorrento lemons — have it ice cold after dinner

## 🏛️ Naples Sightseeing

### Spaccanapoli
- The ancient straight street that "splits Naples" (spacca = split)
- Walk from Via Toledo east through the historic center
- Narrow streets, churches every 50 meters, street vendors, laundry overhead
- This IS the Naples experience — chaotic, alive, real

### Naples National Archaeological Museum (MANN)
- **Why:** Houses the majority of artifacts from Pompeii and Herculaneum
- **Highlights:** Farnese Collection (massive Roman sculptures), Pompeii mosaics (Alexander Mosaic), Secret Cabinet (Roman erotic art)
- **Duration:** 2-3 hours minimum
- **Cost:** €18 (as of 2025)
- **Tip:** Visit BEFORE Pompeii — the context makes the ruins much more meaningful
- **URL:** museoarcheologiconapoli.it

### Other Naples Highlights
- **Cappella Sansevero:** Veiled Christ sculpture — one of the most extraordinary marble works ever created. Small chapel, book ahead. €10
- **Naples Underground (Napoli Sotterranea):** Greek-Roman aqueducts 40m below the streets. Guided tours only, ~90 min
- **Castel dell'Ovo:** Waterfront castle on a tiny island, free entry, great views
- **Via San Gregorio Armeno:** The Christmas nativity scene street (presepe). Craftsmen work year-round

## 🏛️ Pompeii

### Essential Info
- **Distance from Naples:** 25 km southeast
- **Getting there:** Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale → Pompei Scavi (30-40 min, ~€4)
- **2025 Regulations (NEW):**
  - **Daily visitor cap: 20,000 people** — book in advance!
  - Personalized tickets with name and entry time (bring ID)
  - Pre-booking required — same-day entry no longer guaranteed
  - Timed entry slots to manage flow
- **Cost:** €20 (standard, updated Jan 2026), Pompeii+ combined ticket available (valid 2 days)
- **Hours:** 9:00-19:00 (summer), 9:00-17:00 (winter), last entry 90 min before close
- **Duration:** 3-4 hours for highlights, full day for thorough exploration
- **Book at:** vivaticket.com (new from March 2026) or pompeiisites.org

### Tips
- **Go early morning** (9am slot) — less crowded, cooler
- **Bring water and sunscreen** — almost no shade, can be brutal in summer
- **Wear sturdy shoes** — uneven ancient cobblestones everywhere
- **Consider a guide:** The site is enormous (170 acres) and confusing without context. A 2-hour guided tour + free time is ideal
- **Visit MANN in Naples first** for context (see above)
- Early morning or late afternoon slots are less crowded

### Must-See in Pompeii
- Forum (civic center of the city)
- House of the Faun (largest private residence, Alexander Mosaic was here)
- Garden of the Fugitives (plaster casts of victims — haunting)
- Lupanar (brothel with frescoes)
- Amphitheatre (oldest known Roman amphitheatre)
- Villa of the Mysteries (incredible frescoes)

---

## 🏛️ Herculaneum (Ercolano)

### Why Visit
- **Smaller but better preserved** than Pompeii — buried under 20m of volcanic mud (not ash)
- Wood, fabric, food, and upper floors survived — giving a more intimate picture of Roman life
- **Far less crowded** than Pompeii
- You can see it in 1.5-2 hours

### Getting There
- Circumvesuviana train: Napoli → Ercolano Scavi (20 min)
- 10-minute walk from station to entrance

### Tips
- **Do both if you can** — Pompeii for scale, Herculaneum for detail
- If you only have time for one and hate crowds: choose Herculaneum
- The boat houses where 300+ skeletons were found (people waiting for rescue that never came) are unforgettable

## 🏖️ Amalfi Coast

### Overview
A 50 km stretch of cliffside coastline south of Naples — pastel villages clinging to steep mountains above turquoise water. UNESCO World Heritage Site. One of the most beautiful coastlines on Earth.

### The Big Three Towns

#### Positano
- The most photogenic — cascading pastel buildings down to the beach
- Most expensive and most touristic
- Great for: Instagram, beach clubs, shopping (linen clothes, sandals)
- **Beaches:** Spiaggia Grande (main), Fornillo (quieter, 10-min walk)
- **Restaurant recs:** Chez Black (beachfront, seafood), La Tagliata (hillside, family-run, incredible views + food — BOOK AHEAD), Next2 (upscale)

#### Amalfi
- The historic heart — once a powerful maritime republic
- **Duomo di Amalfi:** Stunning 9th-century cathedral with Arab-Norman architecture
- More affordable than Positano
- **Restaurant recs:** Il Teatro (great seafood), Trattoria il Mulino (family-run, off-tourist path)
- Paper museum (Museo della Carta) — Amalfi was famous for handmade paper

#### Ravello
- Perched high above the coast — the cultured, quieter alternative
- **Villa Rufolo:** Gardens with jaw-dropping terrace view over the coast. Richard Wagner was inspired here.
- **Villa Cimbrone:** Walk through gardens to the Terrace of Infinity — one of the most famous viewpoints in Italy
- **Ravello Festival:** Classical music concerts in summer (June-September) in Villa Rufolo gardens
- **Restaurant recs:** Cumpa Cosimo (local legend, family-run since 1929), Rossellinis (Michelin-starred splurge)

### Getting Around the Amalfi Coast

#### SITA Bus
- Public buses run along the coast road (SS163)
- **Cheap:** ~€2-3 per ride
- **Frequent:** Every 30-60 min in summer
- **Cons:** Packed in summer, standing room only, winding roads = motion sickness risk
- Buy tickets at tabacchi shops, not on the bus

#### Ferry
- **Recommended for comfort and views**
- Routes: Naples/Sorrento → Positano → Amalfi (and to Capri)
- **Operators:** TravelMar, Alilauro, NLG
- **Cost:** €8-15 per segment
- **Season:** April-October only
- **Tip:** Sit on the right side (south-facing) for coast views
- No ferry service to Ravello (it's inland/uphill — bus or taxi from Amalfi)

#### Driving
- The SS163 coast road is **legendary and terrifying** — narrow, hairpin turns, tour buses inches from your mirrors, scooters everywhere
- Parking is extremely limited and expensive in Positano/Amalfi
- ZTL (restricted traffic zones) in most towns
- **Verdict:** Don't drive unless you're very confident AND it's shoulder season. Take the ferry or bus.

#### Private Transfer / Taxi
- Most stress-free option, especially from Naples
- Naples → Positano: ~€120-150 (negotiate beforehand)
- Good for groups splitting the cost

### Path of the Gods (Sentiero degli Dei)
- **The** signature Amalfi Coast hike
- Bomerano → Nocelle (above Positano): ~7.8 km, 3-4 hours
- Dramatic cliffside trail with views of the entire coast
- Not technically difficult but some exposure — not for vertigo sufferers
- **Best time:** Early morning before heat
- Take the bus to Bomerano, hike to Nocelle, then 1,700 steps down to Positano (or bus)

### 🍋 Lemon Everything
- The Amalfi Coast is famous for its giant **Sfusato Amalfitano** lemons
- **Limoncello** — made everywhere, buy from small producers not tourist shops
- **Delizie al Limone** — lemon cream-filled sponge cake, the coast's signature dessert
- **Lemon granita** — refreshing slush, perfect in summer
- **Lemon salad** — yes, they eat lemons as salad here (sliced with olive oil, salt, mint)
- **Lemon ceramics** — hand-painted pottery makes great souvenirs
- Visit a lemon grove (limoneto) — many offer tastings

## 🏝️ Capri Day Trip

### Getting There
- **From Naples:** Molo Beverello port → Capri (hydrofoil ~50 min, €22-25; slow ferry ~80 min, €15-18)
- **From Sorrento:** ~20 min by hydrofoil (~€20)
- **Operators:** SNAV, Caremar, NLG
- **First boats:** ~7:00-7:30 AM (take the earliest to maximize time)
- **Last boats back:** ~7:00-8:00 PM (check schedules, varies by season)

### Must-Do
- **Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra):** Sea cave with electric blue water. Transfer to small rowboats at the entrance. €18 entry + €10 rowboat. Often closed due to waves — check conditions. Go first thing.
- **Boat tour around the island:** ~2 hours, see Faraglioni rock formations, sea caves, stunning coastline. ~€20-30 for group tour
- **Monte Solaro chairlift:** From Anacapri to the highest point (589m). Panoramic views of the entire Bay of Naples. €12 round trip
- **Gardens of Augustus:** Overlooking the Faraglioni. Beautiful gardens, iconic viewpoint
- **Capri town + Piazzetta:** The famous little square — glamorous, expensive, people-watching heaven

### Tips
- Capri is **expensive** — even water costs more
- Bring lunch/snacks from the mainland if budget-conscious
- The island has two towns: Capri (lower, glamorous) and Anacapri (upper, quieter, more authentic)
- Funicular connects Marina Grande (port) to Capri town
- A full day trip is enough for highlights; overnight for a deeper experience

## 🛡️ Safety — The Real Talk

### Is Naples Safe?
**Yes, with normal urban awareness.** Naples has a reputation that's worse than reality for tourists.

### The Data (2022-2024)
- Robberies per 100k: 116 (vs Italy avg 43.5) — second-highest after Milan
- Pickpocket reports per 100k: 197.6 (actually below national average of 219.1)
- Homicide rate: 1.2 per 100k (double national, but tourists are virtually never targeted — Camorra violence is internal)
- US Travel Advisory: Level 2 "Exercise Increased Caution" (same as all of Italy)

### Practical Safety Tips
1. **Cross-body bag, zipped** — especially on Circumvesuviana trains and Via Toledo
2. **Phone on a lanyard or in a zipped pocket** — scooter snatching happens
3. **Skip the Piazza Garibaldi area at night** — around the train station is the sketchiest zone
4. **Don't flash expensive jewelry/watches**
5. **The historic center is generally safe** — tourist-heavy areas are well-policed
6. **Scams:** Fake parking attendants (especially near Pompeii), overcharging taxis (agree on price beforehand or insist on meter)
7. **Amalfi Coast is very safe** — wealthy tourist area, virtually no crime concerns
8. **Capri is very safe**

### The Camorra Reality
- Naples' organized crime exists but operates in the suburban periphery (Scampia, Secondigliano)
- Tourists are not targets — bad for business
- You will not accidentally wander into dangerous territory in the historic center

## ☀️ Summer Crowds — Book Ahead?

### Absolutely Yes. Book These in Advance:
1. **Pompeii tickets** — 20,000/day cap, sells out in peak summer
2. **Amalfi Coast hotels** — Positano especially books up months ahead for July/August
3. **Capri ferries** — Buy morning of or day before, but don't assume availability
4. **La Tagliata (Positano)** — Must-book restaurant
5. **Cappella Sansevero** — Timed entry, books out
6. **Train tickets** — Super Economy fares disappear fast

### Crowd Tips
- **July-August** = peak madness on the coast. Prices double. Consider June or September instead
- **September** is arguably the best month: warm water, thinner crowds, lower prices
- **Positano** is always crowded in summer — stay in Praiano or Amalfi for a quieter base
- **Naples itself** is less touristy than the coast — manageable even in August
