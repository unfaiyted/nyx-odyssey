---

## 🚂 Getting There

### Train from Vicenza → Milano Centrale
- **Duration:** ~1h 45m–2h 15m (Frecciarossa/Frecciargento high-speed)
- **Cost:** ~€20-40 each way if booked in advance; €40-55 walk-up
- **Frequency:** Multiple departures per hour on weekdays
- **Station:** Milano Centrale (main hub, connected to Metro lines M2 and M3)
- **Tip:** Book on Trenitalia app 2-4 weeks ahead for best "Super Economy" fares (~€19-25). Italo trains also run this route at competitive prices.
- **Alternative:** Regionale trains exist (~€15) but take 3+ hours — not worth it.

### Day Trip vs Overnight?
- **Day trip:** Feasible if you leave Vicenza by 7-8 AM, return by 10-11 PM. You'll have a solid 10-12 hours.
- **Overnight recommended if:** You want to experience Navigli at night, see The Last Supper (morning slots are best), and not feel rushed. One night is plenty.
- **Budget overnight:** Hotels near Centrale or Navigli from €80-130/night. Hostels from €30-50.

### What to See
