# Las Vegas F1 2026 — Transportation & Getting Around

*Researched: Feb 15, 2026*

## Key Context: F1 Road Closures

The Las Vegas Grand Prix circuit runs **down the Las Vegas Strip** (Las Vegas Blvd). During race week (Nov 17-22, 2026), expect:

- **Full Strip closures** from approximately Sands Ave to Harmon Ave during practice, qualifying, and race sessions
- Road closures typically begin **6-8 hours before sessions** and last **2-3 hours after**
- Race day (Sat Nov 21): Closures likely from early afternoon through ~1 AM Sunday
- **Koval Lane, Frank Sinatra Dr, and surrounding streets** also affected
- I-15 remains open but exits to Strip may be restricted
- Pedestrian bridges and designated walkways will be the primary way to cross the circuit

### 2025 Closure Pattern (expect similar for 2026)
- Wednesday-Thursday: Practice sessions, partial closures
- Friday: Qualifying, extended closures
- Saturday (Race): Most extensive closures, roughly 2 PM – 1 AM

## Airport Transfers (LAS ↔ Strip)

LAS (Harry Reid International) is only **~2 miles from the south end of the Strip**.

### Option 1: Rideshare (Uber/Lyft) — ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Cost:** $15-25 one way (surge pricing during F1 can push to $40-80+)
- **Time:** 10-20 min (non-F1 traffic), 30-60 min during race closures
- **Pickup:** Level 2 of Terminal 1, Level 2 of Terminal 3
- **Tips:** Schedule rides in advance during F1 weekend; prices spike dramatically after sessions end
- **Round trip estimate:** $40-60 (normal), $80-160 (F1 surge)

### Option 2: Taxi
- **Cost:** $20-30 + tip (flat rate ~$23-27 to most Strip hotels)
- **Time:** Similar to rideshare
- **Pickup:** Taxi stands at each terminal
- **Pro:** Flat rate means no surge pricing during F1

### Option 3: Airport Shuttle (shared van)
- **Cost:** $8-15 per person ($16-30 for two)
- **Time:** 20-45 min (multiple stops)
- **Providers:** Bell Trans, SuperShuttle (if operating)
- **Con:** Slow, multiple hotel stops

### Option 4: Hotel Shuttle
- **Cost:** Free (some hotels offer complimentary shuttles)
- **Check with hotel** — many upscale hotels have airport shuttles
- **Con:** Limited schedule, may need to wait

### Option 5: Rental Car Shuttle → Pick up at airport
- See rental car section below

**🏆 Recommendation for arrival (Mon Nov 17):** Uber/Lyft — no F1 closures yet, cheap and fast.
**🏆 Recommendation for departure (Sun Nov 22):** Uber/Lyft or taxi — schedule well before checkout, post-race traffic may linger.

## Getting Around During the Trip

### Walking — ⭐ BEST for the Strip
- **Cost:** Free
- **The Strip is ~4.2 miles end to end** — most attractions within 2-mile stretch
- Pedestrian bridges connect major casino-hotels
- During F1: Designated pedestrian routes around the circuit
- **November weather is ideal for walking:** 45-65°F, low humidity
- **Tips:** Distances are deceptive — block-to-block can be 15-20 min walk. Wear comfortable shoes

### Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)
- **Cost:** $8-15 for short Strip rides (non-surge), $15-30 off-Strip
- **During F1:** Expect 2-5x surge after sessions. Pre-schedule when possible
- **Best for:** Off-Strip restaurants, shows at non-Strip venues, late-night returns
- **Estimated 5-day total:** $80-150 (moderate use, some surge)

### Las Vegas Monorail
- **Route:** MGM Grand → SLS (Sahara) — runs behind east side of Strip
- **Stations:** MGM Grand, Bally's/Paris, Flamingo/Caesars, Harrah's/The LINQ, Convention Center, Westgate, SLS
- **Cost:** $5 single ride, $13 day pass, $36 multi-day (3-day+)
- **Hours:** 7 AM – midnight (Mon-Thu), 7 AM – 2 AM (Fri-Sun)
- **F1 benefit:** Runs independently of road closures — great alternative when Strip is closed
- **Con:** Only east side of Strip, doesn't reach Wynn/Encore, Venetian main entrance, or south Strip (Mandalay Bay, Luxor)
- **Estimated cost:** $13-26 (1-2 day passes)

### The Deuce Bus (RTC Route)
- **Route:** Runs the full length of the Strip + downtown Fremont
- **Cost:** $6 for 2-hour pass, $8 for 24-hour pass
- **Hours:** 24/7
- **Con:** Slow (traffic), likely disrupted during F1 closures
- **Not recommended during F1 race days**

### Rental Car — ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED for F1 Weekend
- **Daily cost:** $40-80/day for economy, $60-120 mid-size
- **Parking:** $20-30/day at Strip hotels (self-park), $35-50 valet
- **5-day estimate:** $300-550 (rental) + $100-250 (parking) = **$400-800 total**
- **Why not:**
  - Road closures make driving near-impossible during sessions
  - Strip hotel parking is expensive
  - Walking + rideshare is cheaper and less stressful
  - Parking structures may have restricted access during F1
- **Only consider if:** Doing significant off-Strip activities (Red Rock Canyon, Valley of Fire, Hoover Dam)

### Tram Systems (Free!)
- **Aria ↔ Bellagio ↔ Vdara/Park MGM** — free tram
- **Mandalay Bay ↔ Excalibur ↔ Luxor** — free tram
- **Mirage ↔ Treasure Island** — free tram (if operating)
- Great for short hops between connected properties

## F1 Weekend-Specific Transport Tips

1. **Walk whenever possible** — most F1 viewing areas, fan zones, and restaurants accessible on foot
2. **Use the Monorail** as your F1-proof backbone for east-side Strip travel
3. **Pre-schedule rideshares** before/after sessions — don't wait for surge to peak
4. **Leave 2x normal travel time** for any car-based transport during race week
5. **Download the F1 Las Vegas app** — will have real-time road closure info and pedestrian routing
6. **Consider location when booking hotel** — being walkable to the circuit saves huge transport hassle
7. **Post-race exodus (Sat night):** Expect 1-2 hour waits for rideshare after the race. Walk to hotel if possible, or wait at a bar/restaurant for crowds to thin
