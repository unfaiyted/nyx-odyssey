# Vegas Attractions & Experiences (Nov 17-22, 2026)

Lightweight guide — outside the F1 race, Faiyt & Gretchen will figure things out themselves. These are the highlights worth knowing about.

## 🔮 The Sphere

The must-see Vegas attraction. A 366-foot LED-covered sphere with an immersive 16K wraparound interior screen (the world's highest resolution).

- **Sphere Experience (immersive film):** ~$50-100/person depending on seating. Currently showing nature/travel films in stunning detail. ~1 hour.
- **Exosphere (exterior):** Free to see from outside — the massive LED exterior is a show in itself, especially at night from the Strip.
- **Worth the premium?** YES — truly one-of-a-kind, nothing else like it in the world. Book in advance; F1 week will sell out.
- **Location:** 255 Sands Ave (behind The Venetian)
- **Website:** https://www.thespherevegas.com

## 🎡 High Roller Observation Wheel

World's tallest observation wheel at 550 feet. 30-minute rotation with views of the entire Strip and surrounding desert.

- **Daytime:** ~$25-35/person
- **Nighttime:** ~$35-45/person (recommended — the Strip lights up)
- **Happy Half Hour pod:** ~$55-65/person — open bar during the 30-min ride
- **Worth the premium?** The Happy Half Hour is a fun splurge for a couple. Regular ride is solid value for the views.
- **Location:** The LINQ Promenade, 3545 S Las Vegas Blvd

## 🚁 Helicopter Tours

Popular for Grand Canyon visits or Strip night flights.

### Strip Night Flight
- **Duration:** 12-15 minutes
- **Cost:** ~$100-150/person
- **Worth it?** Fun but very short. Nice for a special occasion.

### Grand Canyon Helicopter Tour
- **Duration:** 3-4 hours total (flight + landing)
- **Cost:** ~$300-500/person
- **Worth the premium?** If you've never seen the Grand Canyon, absolutely. The aerial views are unforgettable. West Rim tours include canyon floor landing + champagne.
- **Operators:** Maverick, Papillon, Sundance
- **Book early:** F1 week demand will be high

## 🏜️ Day Trips

### Grand Canyon (West Rim)
- **Distance:** ~2.5 hours by car, or helicopter
- **Options:** Bus tours ($100-150), helicopter ($300-500), self-drive
- **Skywalk:** Glass-bottomed horseshoe walkway over the canyon, ~$30 + park entry ~$50
- **Worth it?** If you've never been, it's bucket-list worthy. West Rim is closest to Vegas.

### Hoover Dam
- **Distance:** 45 min from Strip
- **Dam Tour:** ~$30/person (guided interior tour)
- **Worth it?** Easy half-day trip. The engineering is impressive and the views from the bypass bridge are great. Can combine with lunch in Boulder City.

### Valley of Fire State Park
- **Distance:** ~1 hour from Strip
- **Cost:** $10/vehicle entry
- **Worth it?** HIGHLY recommended if you like nature/photography. Stunning red sandstone formations, petroglyphs, easy hikes. Best at sunrise/sunset. November weather is perfect for this.
- **Top spots:** Fire Wave Trail (easy, 1.5 miles), White Domes Loop (1 mile), Elephant Rock

## 🎭 Other Notable Experiences

### Shows & Entertainment
- **Cirque du Soleil:** Multiple shows on the Strip (O, Mystère, KÀ, Love). Budget $80-200/person. Book ahead for F1 week.
- **Meow Wolf's Omega Mart:** Immersive art experience at Area15. ~$50/person. Weird, wonderful, very Instagram-worthy.
- **Fremont Street Experience:** Free light show on a massive LED canopy downtown. Fun evening vibe, more "old Vegas."

### Dining (Experiences)
- Vegas has some of the best restaurants in the world — Gordon Ramsay, José Andrés, Guy Savoy, Nobu, etc.
- **Reservations essential** during F1 week — book 2+ months ahead for anything notable.
