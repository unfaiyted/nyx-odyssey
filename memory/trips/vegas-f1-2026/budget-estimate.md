| Mid | Southwest | Nonstop, F1 week pricing | $700 |
| High | American/United | Connecting, last-minute F1 week | $1,000 |

**Recommendation:** Book Southwest ASAP when schedule opens (~Jan 2026). Free bags + free changes = best value. Add ~$80 for SAT airport parking (6 days).

| High | Wynn/Bellagio | $1,100/night | $5,500 |

**Note:** Add ~$40-55/night resort fees at most Strip hotels ($200-275 extra).
