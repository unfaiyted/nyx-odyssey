# Las Vegas Shows & Entertainment — Nov 17-22, 2026

## Overview
F1 race weekend (Nov 21 night race) means Vegas will be buzzing with entertainment. Many shows run nightly regardless, and F1 weekend typically brings special concerts and events. Book early — F1 weekend sells out fast.

**Key constraint:** Race night is Saturday Nov 21 (~10 PM start), so plan shows around that.
